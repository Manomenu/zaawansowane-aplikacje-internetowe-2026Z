"""PostgreSQL: the connection pool and the schema migrations.

Migrations are numbered SQL files in `migrations/`, applied in name order. Each one runs once
and is recorded in `schema_migrations` with a checksum; the server applies the missing ones
when it starts. A migration is never edited after it ran somewhere: the change goes into a
new file. An edited or deleted one stops the server, because databases that ran the old text
and databases that would run the new one would quietly differ.
